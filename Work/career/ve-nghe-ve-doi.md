#### Paul Vivek

### Abour the nature of business
Boring is the best. Boring means predictable. Product company bet on disrupt-technology, we are service company, we bet on predictability. 

### About technology
Never venture into cutting-edge technology, keep an eye on that and wait until it became stable. For demanding customer, your CTO should prepare supervisionary powerpoint. That’s enough!

### About HR
Move your head of sale into head of recruitment
Create position Day-One Manager
Put every job online for every employee can apply for. 
If you want manager have high salary, pls. make your workforce pyramid as flat as possible
Result of employee satisfaction survey is useless. Put your message in the questions, since everybody will read it.

### About 1B target
It can be negative, since it give you a feeling that you are done, after setting the target.
Target only have some meaning if every employee have a chance to discuss about it.

### About finance
You don’t need to borrow for investment. You take money from saving. You draw resource from your growth. Our business model is: growth is not the option. Growth is the must. You will have a lot problems without growth.

Why you gave shareholder dividend? Convince them that should you give them dividend, they will reinvest in you anyway, since you deliver best return.

### About transformation
You do it everyday. If someone want to create business unit let them do. If 2 units want to do the same domain, why not let them do.

You need 5 bureaucracy: HR, Finance, QA, IT and GA. But give them pressure by setting up SLA and cut budget every year. 

### About sale
You don’t need super-saleman. The best saleman is PM. Saleman is to maintain relationship and control the term of contract.
AM should be responsibility of deliver guy, since customer always feel that sale not in their side, but delivery is in their side.

### About invitation to become CEO of Fsoft
It is your journey, you don’t need such expensive outsider guy like me on the stage. I’m absolutely confident in your success because you are smart and honest.

### About philosophy of life
Life is not linear. You accumulate strength, and suddenly you can jump over your head.
You are young because your mind is young, not depend on your bio age.
Never forget who you are.
